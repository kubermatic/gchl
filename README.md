# gchl

A Go-written Changelog Generator. Create Changelogs based on GitHub pull requests.

## Installation

```
go get -v
go install
```

## Usage

You will need a github personal access token for api calls, create one [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens).
You can pass the token to `gchl` as a flag `--token` or via env variable `GCHL_GITHUB_TOKEN`

Navigate into a repository and get a Changelog of all changes in form of merged PRs between two branches / tags

```
gchl between v1.2 v1.0
```

or since between `HEAD` and another reference

```
gchl since v1.0
```

### Get release notes via PR message annotation

In your pull request use a markdown code block annotated with `release-note` (Don't copy paste the example below as it uses `'` ;))

```
'''release-notes
This text will be visible in changelog
'''
```

and run 

```
gchl between v1.2 v1.0 --release-notes
```
